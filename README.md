## Implemntation of Baum Welch-Algorithm for POS tagging

## To run
 -  Download the source code and datasets
 -  To run on unlabelled data - _python3 main.py_
    -  Predicted a-matrix in results/a-matrix.txt
    -  Predicted b-matrix in results/b-matrix.txt
    -  Most likely 100 words for each tags in results/wordsfortags.txt
    -  Predicted labels for each words in in results/labels.txt
 -  To run on labelled data- in labelled folder _python3 baum-welch--comp.py_ (Heavy computational power required)
